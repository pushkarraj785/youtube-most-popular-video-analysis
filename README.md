# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of YouTube's trending videos to understand the factors that contribute to their success. By utilizing the YouTube Data API v3, the project gathers data on the most popular videos and performs various analyses to uncover insights related to video performance, engagement, and optimal upload strategies.

## Features
- **Data Retrieval**: Data on trending videos is collected using the Google Cloud YouTube Data API v3, focusing on the most popular videos in a specific region (e.g., India).
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared, with key features such as views, likes, comments, video duration, and publish time extracted for further analysis.
- **Category and Video Length Analysis**: Videos are categorized by genre (e.g., Music, Entertainment) to explore how different types of content perform. The impact of video duration on engagement metrics is also analyzed.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Relationships between various metrics (e.g., views, likes, comments) are examined to understand what drives video success.
- **Publish Time Analysis**: The effect of the time of day when a video is published on its subsequent view count is analyzed, providing insights into the optimal upload times.

## Data Retrieval
The trending video data was collected using the [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3), specifically querying the API for the most popular videos in the region specified (e.g., `IN` for India). The script retrieves data on various video attributes including views, likes, comments, tags, and more.

### Code Example:
```python
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

def get_trending_videos(api_key, max_results=200):
    youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=api_key)
    videos = []
    request = youtube.videos().list(
        part='snippet,contentDetails,statistics',
        chart='mostPopular',
        regionCode='IN',  
        maxResults=50
    )
    while request and len(videos) < max_results:
        response = request.execute()
        for item in response['items']:
            video_details = {
                'video_id': item['id'],
                'title': item['snippet']['title'],
                'description': item['snippet']['description'],
                ...
            }
            videos.append(video_details)
        request = youtube.videos().list_next(request, response)
    return videos[:max_results]
```

## Key Insights
- **Category Performance**: Music videos generally have the highest average views compared to other categories.
- **Video Duration**: Shorter videos, particularly those under 5 minutes, tend to have higher engagement metrics.
- **Engagement Metrics**: Strong positive correlations are found between views and likes, as well as views and comments.
- **Optimal Upload Times**: Videos published during peak times (around 5 AM or between 11 AM â€“ 4 PM) tend to receive more views and engagement.

## Conclusion
- **Encourage Engagement**: Prompt viewers to like and comment on videos to increase engagement metrics.
- **Optimize Video Length**: Creating shorter videos can lead to higher engagement, especially in categories like Music and Entertainment.
- **Strategic Uploading**: Scheduling video uploads around peak times can help maximize initial views and overall engagement.
